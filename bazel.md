# bazel experiment with terraform

This is based on starting with https://github.com/dvulpe/bazel-terraform-rules

Interesting read but not that fun.

Also took a detour to look at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-terraform-generator/tree/master

Once again interesting read but not that fun. 

TODO: Going looking for a general bazel project example where I can take what I have done with taskfile.yaml and put this into bazel. 

Reading about bazel and docker, https://earthly.dev/blog/push-docker-image-bazel/


## Install bazel

Install the [binary](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases) and put it on your path something like ```/usr/local/bin/```
