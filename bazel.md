# bazel experiment with terraform

This is based on starting with https://github.com/dvulpe/bazel-terraform-rules

Interesting read but not that fun.

Also took a detour to look at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-terraform-generator/tree/master

Once again interesting read but not that fun. 

Going looking for a general bazel project example where I can take what I have done with taskfile.yaml and put this into bazel.
