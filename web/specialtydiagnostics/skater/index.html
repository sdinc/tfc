<p>Final Project</p>
<p><u><b>Purpose</b></u>-To teach my self how to do a animation with openGL. I
learned that hard coding</font> <font SIZE="2">animation is not a good tactic.
It would be easier to make key fame generation</font> <font SIZE="2">and let the
computer do the in-between steps.</p>
<p><b>Main files</b>-disp_utils.c, formd.c, Makefile, maze.c, final.c,
final_gui.c,</font> <font SIZE="2">final_gui.fd, final_gui_cb.c, xforms_utils.c</p>
<p><b>disp_utils.c-</b>Makes all the openGL calls does the actual drawing. I had
to</font> <font SIZE="2">add a lot of function to this file.</p>
<p><b>formd.c-</b>File used by fdesign to create gui.</p>
<p><b>Makefile-</b>File used to complie the program. Must be in the following</font>
<font SIZE="2">syntax [make sun_xforms].</p>
<p><b>maze.c</b>-File were all world manipulations are done. This is where I
wrote</font> <font SIZE="2">the procedures that the buttons called in order to
do the various tasks on</font> <font SIZE="2">the world.</p>
<p><b>final.c</b>-File where the program runs from. Does any reading of argument</font>
<font SIZE="2">passed inorder to change the window size. It also starts up
xforms and</font> <font SIZE="2">Glut.</p>
<p><b>final_gui.c-</b>gui generated with fdesign</p>
<p><b>final_gui.fd</b>-file used by fdesign to create gui</p>
<p><b>final_gui_cb.c</b>-file that contains the calls to perform tasks that your</font>
<font SIZE="2">buttons should perform.</p>
<p><b>xforms_utils.c</b>-file where all your xforms stuff is done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Running Program</u></b></p>
<p>To compile the program type &quot;make&quot;. To run my program type
&quot;skater&quot;.</font> <font SIZE="2">Then you can use the gui to start the
skater, or by typing the i key. Once</font> <font SIZE="2">The program is
running you can use the gui to change various things. As a</font> <font SIZE="2">default
all lighting is turned on, and the light object button is off.</font> <font SIZE="2">The
light object button turns on wire spheres at the location of the</font> <font SIZE="2">light.
Also you can perform all the maneuvers from the display window.</font> <font SIZE="2">I
did this in order so that you can do more than one move</font> <font SIZE="2">at
a time. It is quite difficult to click the mouse button fast enough</font> <font SIZE="2">so
that you can do more than one move at a time. While on the key-board</font> <font SIZE="2">you
could click all the maneuvers at the same time by pressing all the keys</font> <font SIZE="2">at
the same time.(k,v,s,f,o,3) I also included a bullet time feature.</font> <font SIZE="2">This
means that by clicking the mouse any where in the display window the</font> <font SIZE="2">animation
stops and you can spin the guy so that you can see what he is</font> <font SIZE="2">doing
exactly. By clicking the mouse again you can continue his</font> <font SIZE="2">animation.
Algorithm I basically hard coded everything into display</font> <font SIZE="2">utilities.
I realized that I could used hierarchical structures after I</font> <font SIZE="2">was
already done hard coding everything, and I ran out of time to change back.</font>
<font SIZE="2">This causes animation of the program very difficult to follow. It
also</font> <font SIZE="2">caused the animation of the program difficult to come
up with.</font>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font SIZE="2">The animation works like this:</font> <font SIZE="2">There
is a time variable called t, and a velocity variable called vel and a</font> <font SIZE="2">acceleration
variable called accel. From t the position of the guy is</font> <font SIZE="2">computed,
using polar cords. The value of accel=accel+vel. So this means</font> <font SIZE="2">the
value of vel never changes but the value of accel goes between -16</font> <font SIZE="2">and
16. Which then means that the value of t changes exponentially between</font> <font SIZE="2">-140
and 200. This creates the guy to move like he should in real life.</font> <font SIZE="2">So
that while he is going down he is accelerating and while he is going</font> <font SIZE="2">up
he is decelerating. But it is even more complicated than that! When</font> <font SIZE="2">he
is in the ramp his position is computed by a cylindrical cords, but when</font> <font SIZE="2">he
is in the air his position is computed by liner cords. So at the value</font> <font SIZE="2">of
t=-40 he is at the top of the right side of the half pipe, and when</font> <font SIZE="2">t=220
he is at the top of the left side of the half pipe. When t=90 he</font> <font SIZE="2">is
at the bottom of the ramp. So at the t values between 180, 0 he is</font> <font SIZE="2">moving
in cylindrical cords and at the t between 180,220 and 0, -140 he</font> <font SIZE="2">is
moving in linear cords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tricks work like this: By a sequence of flags and
calls to the methods and the value of t. The globals for the body and the skate
board are set. I figured out the</font> <font SIZE="2">values by trial error
method. All animation is done by calling a portion</font> <font SIZE="2">of
tricks based on the globals flags.</font> <font SIZE="2">It also works like a
game in some respects. If you do not complete the</font> <font SIZE="2">move in
the time you are in the air he falls. It is possible to complete</font> <font SIZE="2">all
moves except the ollie move. I designed it that way so that if you</font> <font SIZE="2">perform
all the tricks at least on trick will make you fall. The trick to</font> <font SIZE="2">make
most moves is to click the gui or key when he is at the bottom of the ramp This
way the second he is in the air he starts performing the trick.</p>
<p><b><u>Problems</u></b></p>
<p>I had problems figuring out the animation mathematics. But I had enough</font>
<font SIZE="2">time to solve this with trial and error. I had serious problems
modeling</font> <font SIZE="2">the ramp. I could not seem to figure out the control
points for a half</font>-<font SIZE="2">pipe. So I used a series of scaled cubes
with cylindrical cords, in a for loop.</font> <font SIZE="2">basically my main
problem is that I needed to use trial error on each part of,</font> <font SIZE="2">each
animation. So the entire project took a lot more time than expected. Plus</font>
<font SIZE="2">the fact that once I had it all done, then we learned how to do </font><font size="2">higher arch</font>
<font SIZE="2">structures in the class.</font></p>
