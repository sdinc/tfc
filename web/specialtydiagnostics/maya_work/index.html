Modeling</PRE>
<PRE>	The creatures were created by a wide range of methods.  I started 
out by modeling the chest.  I drew curve for the sections of the chest and 
lathed them together.  I worked my way down the chest to the stomach with 
these sections lathing them as I went.  Once I was done with the 
body(chest, stomach).  I proceeded to model the head where I started out 
with a nurb sphere and modified the control points in order to make a head.  
I could not figure out how to connect the head to the body mesh so I just 
made a neck that went up into the head.  I had the same problem for the 
arms, and legs I could not get them to connect to the body mesh. For the 
arms and the legs I used the same lathing technique I used on the chest. 
For the hands I started out with a square and face extruded out the 
fingers.  Then I smoothed the entire polygon and my hands were not 
created.  For the feet I started out with the lathing the curves then I 
used the control point from the created nurb by the lathe and morphed them 
into feet.
	I also built a skeleton for the creatures in order to make them move 
some what realistically.  I used the IK-handles inorder to make this 
process easier.
	The light poles I used a simple lathe of a circle along a curve. I 
had a difficult time attaching the light shaded to the light pole, I used 
a combination of lathing curves and the attach command from the nurb 
drop down list.  
	I also used the duplicate command a fair amount to make the 
object some what symmetrical.  But as you can imagine you can not just 
duplicate the object from the right arm to the left arm, they are actually 
mirrored. So after I duplicated the object I and to adjust the meshes to 
make them look like mirror of the other object.  </PRE>
<PRE>Animation
	I start out by adding in the sound track and moving the main joint 
to bounce with the beat.  In order to make the feet and arms bend as he 
bounces I had to set a key at the beginning for the ikhandle. Once a had 
around 180 frames animated to the beat I had them jump up high and then 
land in a stance to attack.  From this point on I used the Ik-handles to 
animates the creature.  When he makes a big move I animated the main joint 
and then the ik-handles to move accordingly.  Over all I animated a total 
of 421 frames.</PRE>
<PRE>problems- When I brought the animation into my lab top the skin seems 
no longer to bind to the actual bones. So I will show from my demonstration 
a wire frame playblast from my home computer.  That way you can see how 
the skin was moving compared to bones. I also had trouble with the sound 
being rendered into the final animation.  So what I did was create a jpg 
seq of frames and then using permier 6.0 I added the sound back in.  But 
of course the final animation is too big to submit. So I will submit a few 
frames from this sequence.</PRE>
<PRE>	Movie-Since I was able to compress the video file Professor 
Willams said that she wanted me to submit it.  If you have any problem 
viewing the avi file you can email at 
(spudnic@cats.ucsc.edu) att: movie conversion
I am not sure exactily which compressior I used, but I believe it was 
DivX fast motion. When I play the file back it says that it is using a 
DivX Decoder Filter. </PRE>
