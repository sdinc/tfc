<PRE>I used cgic which is an ansi c libary to make a cgi file.  I am not 
exactly sure of the specifics on how the makefile works exactly.  I downloaded 
the library from the web and then modified the example that they gave me. I 
also added the ability to connect to psql in the make file. Hence I 
could almost copy the code from project 5 and thus use the same connection 
style.  I basically played around with the files until I had a basic 
understanding of what was going on.  I came up with the conclusion that c 
is not the best for web development and created quite a challenge for 
prog7.

<PRE>compiling All you have to do is to type make and it take care of everything. Make 
sure you are on linux.ic machine when you make the file.  </PRE>
<PRE>Files submitted</PRE>
<PRE>README-A general description the project</PRE>
<PRE>Makefile-The file that is used to compile and post the program</PRE>
<PRE>cgic.c-Not exactly sure what it is used for.  I did not modify that file 
at all. It was required in order to 
make the program compile.          </PRE>
<PRE>cgictest.c-The file which I modified to make the website does all psql 
interactions, and all web interactions.      </PRE>
<PRE>capture.c-Not exactly sure but it says that it is used for debugging cgi       </PRE>
<PRE>cgic.h-contains all the library functions that I used in cgictest.c
