<PRE>To run the program type {dlxsim -x os.dlx.obj -a -S0} the program runs in 
default scheduling, round robin. To run the program in lottery scheduling 
change the -S0 to -S1. To run the program in priority based scheduling 
change the -S0 to -S2. The program is set up to run in the following way. 
It prints out the type of scheduling and all the current processes in the 
runQueue, and the information that goes with those process.  This way you 
can tell what the output should look like. For example when I run the 
program in priority scheduling mode I can see the priority of all the 
process and from that I can tell what process should run.  </PRE>
<PRE>I made a file called {test} which has an example of what I typed and what 
the program outputted. I am pretty sure that my program works from this 
printed out put.  </PRE>
<PRE>The way the program is setup it make ten process, it then calls a setting 
method and that sets the number of tickets and priority of the process 
using a random(); that way I get good variance in tickets and in priority.</PRE>
<PRE>To test my program on other process you can just comment out the code on 
line 882 which is a for loop that makes ten process, and also comment out 
the call to sets() which sets the priority and tickets of all the process 
in the runQueue.</PRE>
<PRE>Problems
I tried to make a option -m{#} which would create {#} that many process 
but when ever I ran the program with the option it did the following
 </PRE>
<PRE>BS(:)&gt;dlxsim -x os.dlx.obj -a -S0 -m2
Stack=0x1fffe0, pc starting at 0x86d0
Got 2 arguments.
Available memory: 0x10110 -&gt; 0x200000.
Argument count is 2.
Argument 0 is -S0.
Argument 1 is -m2.
round robin
FATAL: couldn't allocate memory - no free pages!
Exiting at program request.
Instructions executed: 265577
Time simulated: 0.266 secs
Real time elapsed: 0.229 secs
Execution rate: 1.16M simulated instructions per real second.
 </PRE>
<PRE>Also it you have lots of process to run lets say 20.  It seem to output 
information in packets. So if you are running in round robin, it out puts 
the process in the order that they were created but it prints then in 
clumps of the list.  So it takes a while for the out put to come up.  This 
is most likely dew to the fact the I search through the queue 
many times in different place of my code, so the longer the queue the 
longer the it takes to search, hence the display of clumps that seems to 
occur.  </PRE>
