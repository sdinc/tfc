<H2><A NAME="introduction">Purpose</A></H2>

<p>To use actual physics equations to simulate a single swinging pendulum and a
chain linked pendulum.&nbsp; I obtained the physics equations from, <a href="http://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum1.html">single
pendulum</a>, <a href="http://www.myphysicslab.com/dbl_pendulum.html">double
pendulum</a>, web sights.&nbsp; I used the <a href="http://www.myphysicslab.com/runge_kutta.html">Runge-Kutta
Algorithm</a> to get an numerical approximation for the motion of the
pendulum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<H2><A NAME="build">Building the program</A></H2>
<p>I developed the program in MS visual C++ 6.0 programming environment, and a
unix programming environment.&nbsp;
Before you build the program in unix or in MS visual C++ 6.0 , you must open up the gui.fl using fluid and use
the write command located under the file menu. This will produce gui.cxx and
gui.h.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Readme1.jpg" width="671" height="507">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you have gui.cxx and gui.h you can build the project from the
command line under unix.&nbsp; Assuming that the proper complier, fltk and
openGL libraries are installed, you can simple type make at the command prompt
in the directory the program files are located in. This will create
&quot;prog4&quot;, an executible program.&nbsp; In windows you have to load the
project file then type f7 or click on the build button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the project is built it creates an executeible file that can be run by
typing [control f5]. This will bring up the program.<a href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Research/Datasets/Hung/index.shtml"> </p>

You should now see something similar to this.

<img border="0" src="Readme3.jpg" width="1024" height="768">&nbsp;<P>You have
the choice to change via slider several&nbsp; different parameters about the
pendulum.&nbsp; The gravity, length, mass are to be changed as the animation is
running and the angle is to be changed while the animation is not running.&nbsp;
The button on the right called run, starts and stops the animation.&nbsp; The
camera x y z sliders allow the user to change the view.&nbsp; You can switch
between one ball and two ball pendulums by clicking on the buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<A NAME="Problems"><b><font size="5">Problems</font></b></A>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had serious problems calculating the two ball
pendulum.&nbsp; From some unknown error the second ball appears to be gaining
energy and transferring that energy to the first ball.&nbsp; Thus after a while
the system gains to much acceleration, in ball two causing an explosion in the
movement which is quite chaotic.&nbsp; I thought that the most likely sources
for the error in calculation is the transfer from the&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.myphysicslab.com/dbl_pendulum.html">double
pendulum</a> web sight equation into my implementation. After double checking my
work I was still unable to find a problem.&nbsp; I checked the implicit casting
from double to floats and that all seemed to be ok.&nbsp; After several hours of
checking and double checking my work I moved on and left the problem unsolved.
